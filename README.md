#Sample App

To try this out, run the muddle_backend.py script and point your browser at http://localhost:8081/static/html/sample_app.html

The core files are muddle.js and muddle_backend.py, everything else in here is just a very simple example implementation of the kind of app that can be made with muddle. Look at sample_app.html to see how to use the directives to define a data model in the html, check out the directive definitions and the definitions of the Prop, Prop_Cont, and List_Prop objects in muddle.js to see how they work. Some sample data is already in the db.
